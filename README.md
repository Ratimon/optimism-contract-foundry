## What is it for ?

This OP-Stack-oriented App-chain building block is intended to better introduce and onboard blockchain builder into Optimism 's [Superchain Ecosystem](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer).

> **Note**ðŸ’¡

**The OP Stack can be thought of as software components that either help define a specific layer of the Optimism ecosystem or fill a role as a module within an existing layer.**

![modular stack](./assets/modular_stack.png)

You can check out details in different layers here :[Reference] (https://docs.optimism.io/stack/components).

While developer experience is our top priority, we aim to provide the developer-focused educational tool, such that the new experiment layer2 or Appchain can be quicky bootstapped in superchain community & ecosystem.

## How It Works

`Redprint` consists of:

1. `Redprint Wizard` (**Web UI**)

We are building `Redprint Wizard`, a web application to interactively customize, mix & match, deploy L2 **OPStack** chain / App-chain.

It can be as educational platform to explore and select different versions of smart contract components for different usecases/features. Then, the `Redprint` will generate all required solidity code, including both smart contract parts and their relevant deploy scripts.

By way of illustration, this is a **low-fidelity wireframe** showing how it works:

![ui demo](./assets/demo.png)

It can be seen above that the developers have several options to choose their own desired layer. In our example, it is the **governance** Layer and the [`Safe's Multi-sig`](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-smart-account) is chosen over other Governor-style contract systems.

Another example is **Compound-style contract**. Different sets of parameters can be selected based on the preference. This includes **Voting Delay**, **Voting Period**, **Time Lock Period** and etc.

2. `redprint-forge` (**Framework**)

We are developing `redprint-forge`, a modular solidity-based framework to deploy OP stack smart contract. It works as an engine to:

- Provide type-safe deployment functions for **OPStack**'s smart contract component. This ensures correct type and order of arguments, enhancing security in smart contract development
- Save deployment schemas in json file
- Separate into each of modular and customizable components

The directories below show how modular the `redprint-forge` 's **deployment system** is :

The first one is the deployment script written in [/script](./script), using `redprint-forge` libirary and style guide:

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 000_DeployAll.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 100_DeploySafe.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 200_SetupSuperchain.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 201_DeployAddressManager.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 202_DeployPloxyAdmin.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ A00_ShowPrecomputedAddress.s.sol
```

and the second one is the original script from [`Optimism`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/abfc1e1f37a89405bacd08a3bb6363250d3f68f5/packages/contracts-bedrock/scripts/Deploy.s.sol).

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ script
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Deploy.s.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€
```

As you can see, the original deployment script is a single file, containing all deployment logics for all contracts. Meanwhile, `redprint-forge` abstracts and separates them into modular components, enabling better readabillity for smart contract developer.

Using together with `Redprint Wizard`, the generated solidity code which includes both smart contract parts and their relevant deploy scripts are displayed in customizable way, leading to better developer experience and creativity.

Furthermore, these deployment components are extremely re-usable to replicate the same environment when testing. This will speed up the development process, as the developer does not need to write deployment logics again in test suites.

As you can see in [ProxyAdmin.t.sol](./test/ProxyAdmin.t.sol), we can use those deployment components as a test harness.

```sh
â”œâ”€â”€ test
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ProxyAdmin.t.sol
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€
```

This could, together with **Type-Safe Deployment** feature, also improve overall security, because it potentially minimize false positives from using different deployment logics among production and test environments.

## Installation

[zellij](https://zellij.dev/) is a useful multiplexer (think tmux) for which we have included a [layout file](./zellij.kdl) to get started

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
nvm use 18.17.0
```

```bash
pnpm i
```

## Quickstart

1. Copy [`.env`](./.env) into `.env.<network>.local` and modify as required. For example, this is a file (`.env.optimism.local`)(https://github.com/Ratimon/optimism-contracts-foundry/.env.optimism.local) for optimism network:

```sh

# IMPORTANT!
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# USE .env.local and .env.<context>.local to set secrets
# .env and .env.<context> are used for default public env

> **Note**ðŸ’¡

`deployments/31337/.deploy` is case sensitive.

2. Run multi-windows terminal:

```sh
pnpm start
```

3. Run solidity deploymemt scripts:

These following commands will save deployment artifacts at [`deployments/<chain-id>/`](./deployments/.save.json)

There are two ways:

- Deploy each of individual components:

```bash
pnpm deploy_100_safe
```

```bash
pnpm deploy_201_address_manager
```

```bash
pnpm deploy_202_proxy_admin
```

- Alternatively, Deploy each set of contracts :

```bash
pnpm setup_200_superchain
```

or deploy all of them in single script:

```bash
pnpm deploy_000_all
```

> **Note**ðŸ’¡

The first digit represents the higher level of deployment logic, compared to the last degits. For example, `setup_200_superchain` whose number is `200` includes all of scripts whose numbers starting with `2XX` (e.g. `201` or `deploy_201_address_manager`).

4. Test your contracts

```bash
pnpm test
```
